				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Rochester contains communities with some of the highest food insecurity rates in New York State. As a whole, Rochester has a food insecurity rate of 25.9%, higher than any other in the state. Food insecurity means not having access to healthy nutritious food. Besides food insecurity, people may be on a tight budget or not always have the time to search for new, healthy options at dinnertime. ROC Recipes aims to make healthy meal options more accessible.</p>
