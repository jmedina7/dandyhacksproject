				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Rochester contains communities with some of the highest food insecurity rates in New York State. As a whole, Rochester has a food insecurity rate of 25.9%, higher than any other in the state. Food insecurity means not having access to healthy nutritious food. Besides food insecurity, people may be on a tight budget or not always have the time to search for new, healthy options at dinnertime. ROC Recipes aims to make healthy meal options more accessible.</p>
				<p>ROC Recipes allows users to input a budget, or certain ingredients they have on hand, and different recipes will be generated that uses those ingredients. The recipe and any other  ingredients necessary will be provided along with a recipe. The recipes will be quick and easy to make and provides plenty of options for any given ingredient.</p>
				<p>For people with certain dietary restrictions, the recipes will be filtered to avoid the use of any allergens. DIetary restrictions include vegetarian/vegan, gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, common food allergies such as nuts, and kosher.</p>
				<p> A few resources included on the website are food banks in Monroe County, information on SNAP eligibility and application, budget-friendly grocery stores in the Rochester area, and bus scheduling information to get to any of these locations.</p>
